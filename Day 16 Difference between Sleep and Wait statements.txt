Difference between Sleep and Wait Method:

Sleep():

The sleep() method is a static method of the Thread class and is used to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified period.
It can be called in any part of the class simultaneously without any conflicts.Throws InterruptedException if another thread interrupts during sleep.

It is not recommended in java, because it makes the element wait even it is ready earlier,leading to inefficient test execution.

Syntax:

Thread.sleep(5000);

Implicit Wait and Explicit Wait() Statement:

These statements are used to make the execution wait.It sets a default timeout for all findelements and findelementcalls.It is applied globally to webdriver instance.


Implicit:
----------

The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a “No Such Element Exception”. The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

syntax:

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;


Explicit:
---------
The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. 

You can wait for any element to be present,visible,clickable or for an alert to appear


Syntax:

WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver, 20);

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath( "div/div/a/i")));
